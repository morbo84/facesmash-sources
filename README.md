# Switch: the other world

Software released under two kind of licenses:

* Open source license.<br/>
  If you are developing open source applications under a license compatible with
  [GNU GPL license v3](https://github.com/skypjack/entt/blob/master/LICENSE-GPLv3),
  you can use the software and all its derived works under the terms of
  GPLv3.<br/>
  The open source license is meant to let you use the software and all its
  derived works to build open source and personal projects.<br/>
  Note that, in turn, it requires your project to be licensed under the GPLv3.
  As long as it's fine for you to do that, feel free to use the software and all
  its derived works under the GPLv3.

* Commercial license.<br/>
  If you want to use the software and all its derived works to develop commercial
  products and applications, a commercial license is the more appropriate.<br/>
  It lets you use the software and all its derived works without the provisions
  of the GPLv3 and your source code can be kept proprietary.<br/>
  Contact the author of the project to get your own copy of a commercial
  license. You can can find the mail in the
  [profile](https://github.com/skypjack).
